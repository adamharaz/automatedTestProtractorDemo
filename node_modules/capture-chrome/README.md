# capture-chrome

Capture screenshots using Chrome's new headless mode. This means it does _not_
require a graphical environment / X server to run!

Also you don't even need to have Chromium or Chrome installed, this will fetch an up
to date binary for you.

## Example

Capture a `1024x768` screenshot of [github.com](http://github.com):

```js
const capture = require('capture-chrome')
const fs = require('fs')

capture({
  url: 'https://github.com/'
}).then(screenshot => {
  fs.writeFileSync(`${__dirname}/example.png`, screenshot)
  console.log('open example.png')
})
```

## API

### screenshot({ url, width = 1024, height = 768 })

Capture a screenshot of `url`, returns a `Promise` which resolves with a buffer.

Options:

- `url` Page url
- `width` Viewport width
- `height` Viewport height

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install capture-chrome
```

## CI

This project will work in CI environments like Travis and AppVeyor without any additional configuration. It fetches Chromium itself and doesn't need a X server to run.
