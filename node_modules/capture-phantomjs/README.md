const fs = require('fs')

capture({
  url: 'https://twitter.com/',

})
```

## API

### screenshot({ url, width = 1024, height = 768, wait = 0, format = 'png', clip = true, cookies = [], ignoreSSLErrors = false, SSLCertificatesPath, SSLProtocol })

Capture a screenshot of `url`, returns a `Promise` which resolves with a buffer.

Options:

- `url` Page url
- `width` Viewport width
- `height` Viewport height
- `wait` Time in `ms` to wait after the page finished loading all initial resources
- `format` File format (`png`, `jpg`, `gif`)
- `clip` Cut the image to exact dimensions, removing the fold
- `cookies` Array of cookie objects, see below
- `ignoreSSLErrors` ignore SSL errors
- `SSLCertificatesPath` path for PhantomJS to look for SSL certificates
- `SSLProtocol` Supported protocols: `sslv3`, `sslv2`, `tlsv1`, `any`

### Cookie format

The cookie format is this:

```js
{
  name : 'valid-cookie-name',             // required
  value : 'valid-cookie-value',           // required
  domain : 'the-domain.com',              // required
  path : '/',
  httponly : true,
  secure : false,
  expires : (new Date()).getTime() + 3600 // expires in 1 hour
}
```

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install capture-phantomjs
```

This project requires `nodejs@8.0.0` or later.

## CI

This project will work in CI environments like Travis and AppVeyor without any additional configuration. It fetches phantomjs itself and doesn't need a X server to run.
